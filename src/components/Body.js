                    A street smart Software engineer with a Bachelors degree 
                    in Computer Science. Currently working as
                     an Independent contractor. I love problem solving and had a revelation
                        few years ago that programming is a delightful journey for
                         Problem solvers. I am someone who doesn't get lost in technicality
                          and stick to product vision because of which I often find myself 
                          connecting professionals in business world with programming world.
                    Programming languages& technologies are like tools in my
                     toolbox and I try to keep them sharpand well oiled by testing,
                      POCs and Prototypes. I maintain my presence on many sites, 
                      forums and conferences to stay up to date with best practices 
                      and often write about important things in life.
Be it Frontend, Backend; You name it I have done it all. </p>
